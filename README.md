Find whether the character ‘a’ isin your name or not; if yes find the number of times ‘a’ appears in your name. Print locationsof occurrences of ‘a’ .Try the same for different String objects
### Wrapper Classes
5. Write a Java code that converts int to Integer, converts Integer to String, converts String to int,converts int to String, converts String to Integer converts Integer to int.
6. Write a Java code that converts float to Float converts Float to String converts String to floatconverts float to String converts String to Float converts Float to float.
